# Problem 1

Load R **libraries**:

```{r}

library(tidyverse)

```

Create a **dataframe** called _p1_df_:

```{r}

p1_df <- tibble(
  samp_norm = runif(8),
  samp_greater0 = samp_norm > 0,
  char = sample(LETTERS, 8),
  cats = factor(x = c("orange", "white", "tiger", "tiger", "orange", "white", "white", "tiger"))
)

```

Attempting to take the **mean** of each variable in _p1_df_:

```{r collapse=TRUE}

mean(pull(p1_df, samp_norm))
mean(pull(p1_df, samp_greater0))
mean(pull(p1_df, char))
mean(pull(p1_df, cats))

```

The mean of _samp_norm_ is `r mean(pull(p1_df, samp_norm))`, and the mean of _samp_greater0_ is `r mean(pull(p1_df, samp_greater0))`. Means were not calculated for the variables _char_ and _cats_ because these variables are not numeric or logical. 

Attempting to **convert variables** to numeric type:

```{r eval=FALSE}



```
